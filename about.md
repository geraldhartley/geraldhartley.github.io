Welcome to the blog! My name is Gerald, a Data & Analytics professional from New Zealand, currently based in London, UK.

You'll see a bunch of posts focused around Data and Analytics, since that's kind of what I do. However, you might see the odd personal update, life lesson, public speaking speaking engagement, random thought of the day... you know, just to space it out a bit.

Main contact is through LinkedIn, so lets connect and hit me up there!
