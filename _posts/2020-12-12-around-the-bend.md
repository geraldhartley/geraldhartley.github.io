Hey folks, it's been a minute!

Exciting news for ya, hot off the press! We'll have a proper domain for this blog site very soon! This is where the excitement begins....

<h2>Azure Data Factory - New Blogs are a Coming!</h2>
Now we're coming up to the tail end of 2020 (WOOHOO!), I've got a chance to post a few more blog posts from here on out. The first few will be based around Azure Data Factory, which I've been working with for the last few months. 

It's certainly been a case of "learning by immersion" (aka. thrown in the deep end), but I thrive in this environment, and the learnings I've gained out of this experience have been worthwhile!

All these roads will lead to the <a href="https://newstarsofdata.com/">New Stars Of Data</a> conference in March 2020, where I will hopefully get the opportunity to speak on this series for the very first time! Pretty exciting news, huh? 

<h2>Speaking in front of.... p-p-people?!?</h2>
I've heard it said many times, something along the lines of "I'd rather have (a body part) (inserted / removed) from (orifice) than talk in front of an audience". Can you blame them? Public speaking isn't the most comfortable thing in the world. In fact, if you asked me only 2 years ago that I'd be putting my name forward for an event like this, you'd recieve a response similar to <a href="https://cdn.foodbeast.com/content/uploads/2016/02/U00Zj4Q.jpg">Hank Hill's reaction to well-done steak</a>.

However, it was about 4 years into my career in BI that I recieved a performance review, which indicated that my communication skills were an aspect that needed improvement. I was absolutely enranged, insulted at such an accusation, and required a response which caputured the essence of "fire and fury"...

    <i>I suppose they had a point.</i>

<h2>Raising a Toast!</h2>
It's around this time that I stumbled around <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters International</a> who, despite the name, are not a club that have in-depth discussions on toast (and if there was a club like that, I'd name it "Public-Speaking Masters" just to add to the flaming pit of confusion!). 

Toastmasters is a global organisation, full of like-minded members, who wish to work on 2 important facets of career growth... communication and leadership. During each meeting, members have an opportunity to talk on stage, and also receive and provide evaluations, in a safe and supportive environment. 

Everyone has the opportunity to learn, grow, and improve, and support each other along the way. Think to you did terrible on on stage this morning? Who cares! The clock resets at the end of each meeting, and you get to try it again next time!

Maybe you just <b>think</b> you did bad, and are down in the dumps due to the dreaded <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/negativity-bias">negativity bias</a> that we all encounter. Your evaluator will soon point out the things you did well, and provide useful recommendations that you get to try out next time.

On the topic of nerves, once you've joined a club you like, and have a few meetings under your belt, you will have a muuuuch better handle on the nerves since you first started. These nerves never really go away (nor should they, considering they provide a <a href="https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-nervous-system/">very important function</a>), but by gaining a tiny bit of exposure standing in front of an audience, week-after-week, you'll be in prime form to take on these conferences going forward.

To quote a wise prophet, that time, for me, <a href="https://images.rapgenius.com/e16232925a5374127462bff01f685c2f.500x500x1.jpg">"is now".</a>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
You know the sayings, "Longest journey, single step", "One small step... " etc. I say, "lets make it simple". Sometimes you may just need to take the plunge, dive in there and figure out how make it work. Just make sure you have the people around you who can pull you out!
