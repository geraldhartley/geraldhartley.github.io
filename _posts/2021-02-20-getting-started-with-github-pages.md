## What's up?

Howdy Folks!

It's been a minute since my last post, but I've been working on a presentation for my next upcoming conference <a href="https://newstarsofdata.com/" >New Stars Of Data</a>. I might have mentioned about this in one of my earlier posts, but boy, does it come around quickly!

I managed to get the chance to do my first dry run of this session in-person, at my local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SQL-SERVER-User-Group-Christchurch-New-Zealand/">SQL Server and Data Management User Group</a> in Christchurch. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=150NsJws_Eg">Video</a>]

Happy with how things went, and this gave me an opportunity to come up with so many new ideas for content. I'm interested in exploring the topics in the session in greater detail, which I'll publish as blog posts on a regular basis.

Before all that, lets talk about how we got here... as in, this website 'here'. I've made the choice to use GitHub pages as my platform of choice, as I discovered many other developers were using this as their blogging platform also.

## Github Pages - The Why? (my needs)

Simplicity, performance, accessibility, upkeep + maintenance time - these are all important factors which go in to deciding on a platform. These are all factors that GitHub provides, making it the perfect entry level blogging platform.

## How I chose a solution - The How? (the options)

So let me present to you the reasoning and decisions I made for using GitHub pages, and how to quickly turn around a blog of your own! Here are the steps I followed to quickly and easily set up a new GitHub Pages website from scratch. 

## What is Github Pages? - The What

In short, Github Pages is a service provided by Github to host static website pages.

Of course, there are limitations. In exchange for simplicity, you may find that functionality isn't as rich as on existing platforms, such as Wordpress. However, for my current purpose - that is, to publish a blog, any blog, so help me blogâ€¦  this will do. Plus, if I do change platforms, I can quickly and easily migrate the posts I have since they're all stored in files. Pretty cool, huh?

### Not So Great

## 0-to-Blog with Github Pages

### What You Will Need
- <a href="https://github.com/">A GitHub Account </a>
- (Optional): Domain Name hosting (such as <a href="https://namecheap.com/">the one I used</a>)

Yep, that's it. Nice short list, huh? Github handles all the hosting, and display 

### Instructions

Optional tasks include: creating a new custom domain address & email (eg. gerald@geraldhartley.com)
