Hey folks, it's been a minute!

Exciting news hot off the press. We'll have a proper domain for this blog site very soon! This is where the excitement begins....

Now we're coming up to the tail end of 2020 (WOOHOO!), I've got a chance to post a few more blog posts from here on out. The first few will be based around Azure Data Factory, which I've been working with for the last few months. 

It's certainly been a case of "learning by immersion" (aka. thrown in the deep end), but I thrive in this environment, and the learnings I've gained out of this experience have been worthwhile!

All these roads will lead to the <a href="https://newstarsofdata.com/">New Stars Of Data</a> conference in March 2020, where I will hopefully get the opportunity to speak on this series for the very first time! Pretty exciting news, huh? 

Clearly, conferences aren't some, as they're not the most comfortable things in the world to do. In fact, if you asked me only 2 years ago that I'd be putting my name forward for an event like this, you'd recieve a response similar to <a href="https://cdn.foodbeast.com/content/uploads/2016/02/U00Zj4Q.jpg">Hank Hill's reaction to well-done steak</a>.


You know the sayings, "Longest journey, single step", "One small step... " etc. I say, "lets make it simple". Sometimes, you may  need to take the plunge, dive it in there and figure out how make it work. Just make sure you have the people around you who can pull you out!
