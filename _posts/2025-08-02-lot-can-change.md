About to celebrate my 3 year anniversary from my previous blog post, woohoo! Not quite what I intended when I started, but about the average experience when it comes to blogging on the regular.

So after 3 long years, why are we back here? Turns out a lot can happen within 3 years, so I thought it best to start documenting before I start forgetting what I've done.

Since the last brief, I've done the following:

- Served as an Operations Management role for 2 years
- Moved from NZ to London (first time visting & living outside NZ)
- Started a new role working within a UK-based company
- Attended SQLBits 2025 and Fabric February 2025 in Norway (first time)

Thankful in having served as Operations Manager during my time at Fulton Hogan, despite being one of the most challenging roles I've ever had. If not for this role, I wouldn't have built the confidence or motivation to make the hard decision to leave it all behind and move to the other side of the world.

Now I'm coming up to the 1 year mark of living overseas, which I'll have more thoughts on in a separate post. One of the biggest reasons for moving were the career and networking opportunities, such as attending data conferences and Meetup groups. One group in particular is the Code and Chat Meetup, who meet at London's National Theatre every Saturday morning. Working alongside and hearing stories from talented coders has inspired me to start focusing on what I should have focusing since the start.... creating content!

This post is the kickstart of my "maker" schedule, and an overall reduction of "consuming" content. I'll be aiming to either publish or work on creating a blog or presentation every Saturday morning. Expect this blog to contain snippets of work that's worth talking about, while I start generating content for future presentations and projects.

AI adds an interesting element. As an early adopter of AI generated content, I'm amazed at how far it's come. No doubt I'll be using it to help refine my thoughts and ideas, but the aim of these blogs will be a journal written in my own words.... the rough diamonds waiting for refinement.

Evidence of work + record of journey - that is the ultimate purpose of this blog.
