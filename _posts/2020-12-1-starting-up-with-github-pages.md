title: Starting Up with GitHub Pages

Looks like we have our very first shiny and new blog post! Here's to many more to come!

Right now I'm in the midst of setting up my blogging environment using GitHub pages, so lets call it a bit of a journal in the meantime. Tools I'm using:

- Docker (development environment)
- Ruby / Jekyll (local environment) 
- VS Code (code editor)

Without any knowledge with Ruby & Jekyll whatsover, so far this is a fairly straightforward process. If it goes all well, let's do a blog post about the setup, and if not... well, lets not that happen.

<h2>Why GitHub Pages</h2>

----

These are early days. While I could investment some coin in a Wordpress blog or similar, GitHub pages is more than capable of handling my requirements, and providing performance and reliability. It also helps with consistency with my GitHub environment, and reduces the number of touchpoints I have to manage with Wordpress management. 

Only so much we can do in a day, so this is a productivity win for sure!


<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>

----

There'll be a lot of playing around in these early days, but I intend that this blog will grow and develop. Once I set out to do something, be sure that I'll be persistant (ok, stubborn) in completing my endeavours!

Back to this setup, need to restart... ahhh, typical!
