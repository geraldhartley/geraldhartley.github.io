As I mentioned on a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geraldchartley?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYm40QBDdTTXsUwaKgXdaHkwPZRSmfMuNM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BXoSfzQwtQmudhO6jZIsuRw%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base-actor_container&lici=evQrLrPSRq%2ByRwhIUdLK2w%3D%3D">LinkedIn Post</a>, what a whirlwind of a weekend so far!

Now that only a few hours of it remain, I'll use the time to reflect on the journey so far (the life journey that is, not the <a href="https://newstarsofdata.com/" >Data Journey covered here</a>)

At the risk of being overly repetitive, I couldn't have made it this far without an amazing team of people who have helped me along the way!

- Read Donnell - For being the mix of Obi-Wan, Yoda, Gandalf (and a bit of Borat mixed in for good measure) that his once-young Padwan most definitely needed 
- Penny Baker (and the team at IAG) - whether she meant to or not, gave me the kick up the pants I needed to take my career and communication skills seriously
- Dustin Dorsey - although separated across timezones, gave me advice and guidance all the way up to the big day. I hope this was as fun for you as it was for me!
- Everyone at Boaters Toastmasters - Although 3 months of prep went into the presentation itself, it was the 3 years of regular weekly practice which helped me absolutely nail, not only the presentation, but winning the Toastmasters Humourous Contest the following day!

If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing... but if I had to, I might write down the winning lottery numbers first. ;) 


Forever Grateful -
